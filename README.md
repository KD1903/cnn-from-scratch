# cnn-from-scratch
making Convolution Neural Network from scratch without using any prebuilt framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch

work done:
structure to make classes for layers and model is finalized
tested sample con2d layer with custom matrix (location: test/conv2d_test.py)

TODO:
test layers as per model pipeline
add layers in model
add activation function
add loss and optimizers
implement all tested layer and model in pipeline
